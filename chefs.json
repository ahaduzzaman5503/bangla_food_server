People eat Panta Ilish in the morning of Pohela Boishakh and then take part in cultural programs. The flavorful, crispy and delicious hilsa fish served with water-soaked cold rice and spicy bharta presents a combination of salty and chili tastes. You will love it after your first mouthful. Another fish, American shad, tastes like hilsa, so you can buy that and have yourself some Bengali pleasure."

There are different ways of grilling chicken and there are many variations of spices that are used. Many restaurants roast chickens in a glass oven placed outside to entice people in to eat. It’s a very successful strategy.\n\nNow, it is mostly eaten with Naan Roti. Naan Roti is an oven-baked leavened flatbread—the perfect food with chicken. The bread is a little sweet while the chicken is spicy. This combination creates a fabulous wild taste in your mouth."

This is quite possibly why the dish is so popular for breaking fast during Ramadan."

Some believe Rasgulla originated in East India while others claim is was Bangladesh. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena and semolina, cooked in a light syrup. The syrup soaks into the dumplings, creating soft, fluffy, syrupy white-colored sweets that melt in the mouth. They can be eaten hot, cold or at room temperature: and each one tastes different."

          "recepe_bio": "This is the second most consumed food at festivals and celebrations after biryani. Here, the tradition of eating something sweet after a heavy meal is served by Misti Doi. Mishti Doi is fermented sweet dahi, originating from the Bogra district of Bangladesh. It is mainly made with milk and sugar, but it differs from plain yoghurt due to the preparation technique. Mishti Doi is prepared by boiling milk until it thickens slightly, sweetening it with sugar, either Gura (brown sugar) or khejur gura (date molasses), and allowing the milk to ferment overnight. Earthenware pots are always used for making dahi because the water gradually evaporates through its porous sides. This further thickens the yoghurt, but also creates the right temperature for the culture to grow. The result is a pale yellow yoghurt which is always served on a custom-made earthen plate. Misti Doi tastes elegant yet is comforting and sweet. It has a creamy, pudding-like texture with a deep, rich flavor of dark caramel and a touch of acidity that makes it refreshing."

The whey is then discarded and the milk solids are drained, cooled and kneaded into a dough. The dough is divided into small balls, which are cooked in hot water with a little rose water in it. The balls are then cooked in milk with saffron, pistachios, and kheer as stuffing. These soft, spongy cheese dumplings soaked in sweet, cardamom, and saffron milk taste sweet, creamy, and spongy."
