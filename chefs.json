People eat Panta Ilish in the morning of Pohela Boishakh and then take part in cultural programs. The flavorful, crispy and delicious hilsa fish served with water-soaked cold rice and spicy bharta presents a combination of salty and chili tastes. You will love it after your first mouthful. Another fish, American shad, tastes like hilsa, so you can buy that and have yourself some Bengali pleasure."
